# 📊 Excel Dashboard Project

Welcome to my Excel Dashboard project! This dashboard was built to visualize and analyze a dataset effectively using only **Microsoft Excel**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I used Excel to:
- 📂 Import and clean raw data
- 🧹 Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize entries
- 📈 Create interactive **visualizations** including charts and graphs
- 🧮 Summarize insights using pivot tables and slicers

The main goal was to transform raw data into a **clear and interactive dashboard** that helps in data-driven decision making.

## 💡 Key Features
- Data Cleaning using Excel formulas and tools
- Interactive visuals (Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Line Graphs, etc.)
- Easy-to-use layout for exploring insights
- Designed for non-technical users to understand the data quickly

## 📎 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard Design)

## 📁 Files
- `Excel_Dashboard.xlsx` – Contains the full cleaned dataset and final dashboard
- `README.md` – You’re here!
